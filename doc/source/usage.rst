Using FLACManager

:Release: |release|

Configuring FLACManager
-----------------------

FLACManager depends on a configuration file, *flacmanager.ini*, which
resides alongside the *flacmanager.py* script in the file system.

If *flacmanager.ini* does not exist when FLACManager is run (e.g. on the
first run), it will be created with default/empty values. In this case,
FLACManager will not allow you to proceed until you provide several
required configuration values:

The default configuration looks like this::

   [FLACManager]
   __version__ = 0.8.1
   title = FLACManager ${__version__}

You **must** provide values for your music *library_root* directory; the
Gracenote *client_id*; and MusicBrainz *contact_url_or_email* and
*libdiscid_location*. All other configuration settings may be left as-is
or changed to your preferences.

To obtain a Gracenote *client_id*, you must register for a
`Gracenote Developer <https://developer.gracenote.com/>`_ account and
create an application (you can call it "FLACManager"). Copy the Client
ID for the created application and paste it into the *flacmanager.ini*
file. FLACManager will take care of registering the application and
persisting the *user_id* for you.

Running FLACManager
-------------------

When you launch FLACManager (assuming you have already created/populated
the *flacmanager.ini* file with valid values), it looks for an inserted
CD-DA disc:

.. image:: waiting.png

FLACManager is polling your optical drive in the background, and will
continue to do so until it detects that a disc has been inserted.

Once a disc has been detected, FLACManager begins aggregating metadata
from Gracenote and MusicBrainz:

.. image:: aggregating.png

You can abort the aggregation process by ejecting the disc.

If aggregation fails, an error dialog will describe the failure. Once
this dialog is dismissed, you will be presented with options to either
retry the metadata aggregation or edit the metadata as-is:

.. image:: aggregation-failure.png

.. warning::
   If you choose to edit the metadata as-is, the editor may not contain
   all aggregated metadata (or any at all).

If metadata aggregation completes successfully, you will be presented
with the editor interface prepopulated with the aggregated metadata
values:

.. image:: tagging.png

Here you can select from the aggregated metadata values or enter your
own. Some fields present the option to "Apply to all tracks," which does
exactly as it suggests - copies the current value to the corresponding
field of every track.

By default, all tracks are "included," which means they will be ripped
to FLAC and MP3. To exclude a track, simply uncheck the box.

.. versionadded:: 0.8.1
   You can now change the folder/file naming templates for the current
   album directly from the UI. If you specify templates that differ from
   the defaults (defined in *flacmanager.ini*), then those custom naming
   templates will be included in the persisted metadata for this album.

.. versionadded:: 0.8.0
   Custom Vorbis comments and ID3v2 tags may be added at the album or
   track level.

A custom comment/tag added at the album level will be copied to all
tracks. If it is later deleted from the album level, it will also be
deleted from all tracks **unless the value was changed for a particular
track** (in which case the custom comment/tag will remain for that track
only).

.. image:: albumcustom.png

.. note::
   Custom comments/tags at the album level cannot be modified once
   created; they must be deleted and re-added to change the value.

.. image:: trackcustom.png

When you are satisfied with the metadata values, click the "Rip and tag"
button to begin the encoding process:

.. image:: ripping.png

As soon as the "Rip and tag" button is clicked to begin the encoding
process, all album and track metadata field values are automatically
saved. If ripping fails for any reason, re-inserting the disc will cause
that persisted metadata to be restored so that you don't have to
re-enter the information by hand. If a cover image was persisted, it
will be opened in Preview automatically when the metadata is restored.

Once all included tracks have been encoded to FLAC and MP3, the "Eject"
button is enabled and you can eject the disc. FLACManager then waits for
another disc to be inserted.

:sup:`â€ ` if FLACManager finds a barcode for the disc in the aggregated
metadata (MusicBrainz includes this value when it is known), then a
custom Vorbis "BARCODE" comment is added at the album level and copied
to all tracks
